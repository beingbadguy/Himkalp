      "name": "Muscle Gain",
      "description": "Muscle gain is a process that involves resistance training, proper nutrition, and sufficient rest to promote muscle hypertrophy. The body needs to be subjected to stress, usually through weightlifting or bodyweight exercises, in order to stimulate muscle growth. This process breaks down muscle fibers, and when they repair, they grow back stronger. Along with resistance training, consuming a protein-rich diet helps to repair and build muscle tissue. Adequate sleep and recovery time are also vital to the process, as muscle growth primarily occurs during rest periods.",
